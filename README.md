# MKRank Data

This is the data used to build the lists in MKRank.

The general format is:

```json
{
  "title": "Item Title",
  "type": "{switch, board, etc}",
  "tags": ["one", "two", "three"],
  "uid": "type-description",
  "image": "path to image",
}
```

If you would like to see a specific list (or spotted an error/omission), please submit a pull request.

Thanks!
